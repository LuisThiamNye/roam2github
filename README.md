# Roam2Github

Inspired by https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git

### Differences

- Uses Node (rather than Python).
- Only backups up JSON (markdown causes too many errors)
- better error debugging

### Demo with instruction how to use

https://github.com/everruler12/roam2github-demo

### Future Plans

- [ ] edn support
- [ ] multiple graph backups in same repo
